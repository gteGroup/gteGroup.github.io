<p>
    The project management framework should be used to manage a project at GTE Group. Our vision is to have a succinct and 
    disciplined approach to our management of projects to allow us to consistently deliver outstanding results. 
    When our projects are delivered with the ‘GTE Wand’ we are reinforcing our quality systems that our clients will 
    continue to rely on.
</p>
<p>
    This procedure can be thought of as a guide and a central reference point for all systems that GTE use to deliver 
    outstanding projects. The document is structured to follow the typical lifecycle of a project through the phases 
    that GTE are involved in and should be constantly used as a point of reference to verify that the output of our work 
    is consistent with the ‘GTE way’.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of projects with Functional Safety aspects, the requirements of AS61508 and the associated application 
    specific standard(s) must be followed. As such, this procedure has no guidelines for the Functional Safety 
    requirements, however, recognises that it does exist and appreciates integration points throughout the project 
    lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    GTE project management is loosely aligned with Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) standards.
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This guideline covers all awarded projects undertaken by GTE, except where these are exclusively Functional Safety 
    related and thus guided by the requirements of AS61508.
</p>
<p>
    The management of prospective projects through to project award is also not covered by this guideline
     – refer to GTE-1002-PRC-013 Project Process Management Procedure.
