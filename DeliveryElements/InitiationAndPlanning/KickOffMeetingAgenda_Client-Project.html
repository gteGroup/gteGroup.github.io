title: Delivery Elements | Initiation & Planning | Kick-Off Meeting Agenda (Client - Project)
---
<a href="https://gtegroup.github.io/"><< index</a>
<p>
    Kick-off meetings with the client are mandatory for all GTE projects.
</p>
<p>
    Meetings must be minuted using the appropriate template in Section 9.4. The client project manager will generally 
    arrange the meeting, however, should that not be the case the GTE project manager is accountable to GTE for 
    doing so.
</p>
<p>
    In rare instances, it may be necessary or appropriate to combine this meeting with the internal project/resourcing 
    kick-off meeting.
</p>
<p>
    Client kick-off meetings may be conducted by phone in some instances, but this does not negate the need for 
    formal minutes. For higher classification projects, there may be more significant numbers of attendees 
    including GTE and client technical leads, and client stakeholder representatives.
</p>
<p>
    The meeting is intended to be broad ranging, covering both technical and commercial discussions. The meeting 
    minutes template should be used as an agenda. Agenda items include:
