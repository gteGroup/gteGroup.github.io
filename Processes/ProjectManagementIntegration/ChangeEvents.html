<p>At GTE, we value integrity in all that we do. When it comes to delivering a project, we follow our integrity charter 
    value by delivering what we say we will deliver. The scope of a project should be well thought out, and thoroughly 
    estimated to cover all possibilities before the work commences so that change is controlled from the onset, and the 
    need to burden the client with surprises and variation requests is avoided so far as is possible.
</p>
<p></p>
    Nonetheless, changes can occur. The key control in mitigating reputational damage, cost overruns and/or failure to 
    deliver is in openly, and transparently communicating change to the relevant stakeholders.
</p>
<p>Project change will generally manifest as an impact to scope, schedule, cost or a combination of each. GTE manages any 
    change under an integrated approach that assesses the impact to all project limitations which extend beyond just the 
    above dimensions. These limitations include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scope,</li>
    <li>Cost, </li>
    <li>Schedule,</li>
    <li>Quality,</li>
    <li>Risks,</li>
    <li>Resources, and</li>
    <li>Customer satisfaction.
</ul>
<p>
    As an example, the impact of an increase in the project scope is not a simple exercise of assessing the cost and schedule 
    impact. The additional work may increase resource loadings beyond capacity or result in additional risk to GTE that also 
    needs to be considered. For this reason, any change to the project is assessed for impact using the same integrated 
    approach.
</p>
<p>
    The project manager is accountable for ensuring that all changes are identified, assessed, and appropriately communicated.
     The project team is responsible for the identification of possible change events, and for communicating these to the 
     project manager and assisting with assessing the impact.
</p>
<p>
    Any change that has an impact on the client must be communicated by the project manager to the client. The means for 
    communication varies for fixed price and reimbursable projects.
</p>
<p>
    There may be instances where a project change will be absorbed by GTE, and in these instances it may be appropriate not 
    to communicate the event to the client. The project manager must ensure that the change event is fully assessed across 
    the above project limitations and it can be confirmed that there is no auxiliary client impact that may not be 
    immediately evident and should be communicated.
