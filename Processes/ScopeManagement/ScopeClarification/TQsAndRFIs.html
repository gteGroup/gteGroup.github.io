title: Processes | Scope Management | Scope Clarification | TQs & RFIs
---
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
    All queries to the client of a technical nature for projects undertaken by GTE, should be raised as either a TQ or an 
    RFI using the Smartsheet form. This form generates an entry into the enterprise wide TQ/RFI Register providing a uniform 
    approach that assists with tracking and management with benefits such as automated approval workflows and email 
    follow ups.
</p>
<h3>TQs</h3>
<p>
    TQs are contractual documents requiring formal contractual replies. The project manager must manage the client 
    relationship such that it is accepted that TQs will be raised for any client response upon which GTE will rely 
    technically. Queries made via other means such as email cannot necessarily be relied upon contractually in the 
    event of a dispute and are not tracked and managed with the attention afforded by GTE’s Smartsheet process.
<p>
    GTE can appear overly commercial if the client communication is not managed appropriately, and this has the potential
    to adversely affect the relationship with the client. The project manager should ensure that TQs are seen as presented
    as routine process and a necessary means for clarifying the scope and ensuring the client receives the product it 
    expects, rather than a commercial coverage exercise. The TQ wording is important in this messaging. 
</p>
<p>
    All TQs must be signed as approved by an appropriate client representative under the contract.
</p>
<p>
    Where dispensation or deviation from a specific scope stipulation or applicable standard is required, the TQ will 
    expressly state that approval to deviate is sought.
</p>
<h3>RFIs</h3>
<p>
    RFIs should be used to formally register requests for client input data which may include site survey data, 
    existing software or settings files, vendor drawings forming a basis for design, etc. Whilst it is possible that 
    simple email requests may suffice for such data in many instances, using the Smartsheet process again provides 
    tracking and management at minimal additional burden, and is consequently highly recommended for all projects. 
    Upon commencement of the execution delivery elements, the technical team should raise RFIs for all client input data 
    set out in the original proposal.
</p>
<p>
    As with TQs, the messaging is important around RFIs to ensure these are seen as a valuable part of GTE's project
    management process that will deliver a benefit for the client's project in the form of transparent communication of
    necessary inputs that assists the client in providing these in to a timeline that supports the project schedule.
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
    TQs and RFIs are to be raised and managed through a project specific 'TQ and RFI Register' in Smartsheet. The Smartsheet 
    automates the required workflows and notifications, and provides standardised reporting.
</p>
<h3>Pre-Requisites</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It is assumed the workspace for the project has been created from the project workspace template. If this has 
        not yet been done, first refer to "Creating Project Workspaces in Smartsheet".</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Locate the sheet named ‘Pxxxx_TQandRFI_Register [TEMPLATE]’ in the project workspace.</li>
    <p><em>Note: If the sheet cannot be located or was deleted, open the project workspace template and right-click 
        the file of the same name, choose ‘Save as New’ and save it to the relevant project workspace.</em></p>
    <li>Open the sheet and rename it according to the template convention by clicking the existing sheet name in the header 
        bar, where:
        <ul>
        <li>‘xxxx’ is the Project ID, and </li>
        <li>'[TEMPLATE]' should be removed from the name.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Open the Sheet Summary and set the 'Project ID' field to the appropriate value (excluding the leading "P").</li>
    <p><em>Note: The Sheet Summary can be opened using the summary icon   on the right menu bar. See the Smartsheet 
        documentation here for more detailed instruction.</em></p>
