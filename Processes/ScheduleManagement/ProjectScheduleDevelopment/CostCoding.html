<p>
    Cost units are designated by applying cost codes to activities or summaries in the project schedule within Smartsheet. 
    Each cost unit is created in the cost tracking system for resource costings to be assigned to, and these then become 
    the project control accounts.
</p>
<p>Where applicable, activities at any level of the WBS must be coded as an element of the project Cost Breakdown 
    Structure in the "Cost Code" column of the project schedule in Smartsheet. The level(s) at which cost assignments 
    are made, and name of the cost units, must be in accordance with {{ Cost Management (TBA) }}.
