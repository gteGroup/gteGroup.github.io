<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
    A consistent project schedule structure is required to facilitate team familiarisation and to present uniform
    to the client for all GTE projects. The GTE standard project schedule also includes reporting calculations
    required for organization wide analysis. The following describes the process for
    generating a standard project schedule in Smartsheet..
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
    The project schedule is to be created and managed in Smartsheet. The GTE standard Smartsheet template
    provides for standardised reporting and overall project management.
</p>
<h3>Pre-Requisites</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It is assumed the workspace for the project has been created from the project workspace template. 
        If this has not yet been done, first refer to <a href="ProjectScheduleSetup.html"
          >Project Workspace Setup</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Locate the sheet named 'Pxxxx_Schedule [TEMPLATE]' in the project workspace.
        <p><em>Note: If the sheet cannot be located or was deleted, open the project workspace template and 
            right-click the file of the same name, choose 'Save as New' and save it to the relevant 
            project workspace.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>Open the sheet and rename it according to the template convention by clicking the 
        existing sheet name in the header bar, where:
        <ul><li>'xxxx' is the Project ID, and </li>
            <li>'[TEMPLATE]' should be removed from the name.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Open the Sheet Summary and set the 'Project ID' field to the appropriate value (excluding the leading "P").
        <p><em>Note: The Sheet Summary can be opened using the summary icon
