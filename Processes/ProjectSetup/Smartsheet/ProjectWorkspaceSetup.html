<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
    A consistent location and structure of project assets is required. The following describes the process for
    generating a standard project workspace in Smartsheet, which includes standard templates for various project
    management processes and establishes uniform reporting and dashboarding.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<h3>Pre-Requisites</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A Smartsheet license is required.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Copy the template workspace named 'xxxx_GTE ProjectWorkspaceTemplate' in Smartsheet
         by choosing 'Save as New'.
        <p><em>Note: To copy a workspace, right click it in the workspace tree and choose 'Save as New'. 
            See the Smartsheet documentation here for more detailed instruction.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>Name the workspace according to the template convention, where:
        <ul><li>'xxxx' is the Project ID, and</li>
            <li>'GTE' should be replaced with the Client's name in pascal case, and</li>
            <li>'ProjectWorkspaceTemplate' should be replaced with the project name as it reads in the 
                <a href="https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/cjMrq22wxV6pHhfX2mJMWJpgW2vFxr86hfc2Vrh1"
                    >Project Register</a> (which should be pascal cased).
                <p><em>Note: Pascal case should be interpreted as all words capitalised, without spaces, 
                    and with underscores used to separate words where the first word ends in a capital 
                    (eg SCADA).</em></p>
            </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>When presented with options:
        <ul><li>Under 'Sharing Options', check 'Sharing'. The templates within the workspace will adopt the 
                appropriate standard collaborators and you can add others later as required.</li>
            <li>Under 'Automated Workflow & Alert Options', check 'Include recipients & permissions settings'. 
                <!-- TODO: What does this actually do? May be worth explaining? Gibbo suggested he knows but didn't elaborate at the time. -->
            <li>Leave the 'Data & Formatting Options' all checked. Some templates are pre-populated with 
                reference data and this ensures those rows will be copied to the new workspace, and forms, 
                shared filters, etc will also be available.</li>
            <li>Leave 'Newly created sheets' selected.</li></ul>
    </li>
</ol>
