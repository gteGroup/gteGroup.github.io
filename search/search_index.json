This categorization, and in particular the underlying classification , determines the types of project management and engineering records and the general level of rigour required to manage the project, in accordance with the Output Applicability Grid . The categorization also considers the type of project and the disciplines involved. Output Applicability Grid Certain activities must occur, and certain outputs must be generated, throughout the execution of a project undertaken by GTE. The Output Applicability Grid handles the mechanics of determining, from the project categorization, which activities and outputs \u2013 and detail within these \u2013 are necessary. In many cases a particular output or activity may be mandatory across all projects, however the underlying detail could differ vastly through the Output Applicability Grid stipulations for the components of that output. Phases, Processes and Delivery Elements Projects generally span one (lifecycle phase)[#lifecycle-phase] of a client project. These lifecycle phases are outlined to clarify their difference from the distinct project phases within the performance of a project undertaken by GTE. GTE projects are generally structured from a work breakdown perspective in accordance with typical phases of execution that include design, development, and testing. However, the recognition that there are overlapping and enveloping bodies of project management work \u2013 or \"process groups\" \u2013 that occur alongside this direct delivery effort leads to what GTE terms delivery elements . Within the delivery elements that can be considered \"indirect\" to the technical delivery \u2013 or execution \u2013 of the work, project management processes such as cost and schedule management must occur. GTE aligns with PMBOK standards on these processes , and the overall GTE project management process is based around these. Fundamentals All projects, regardless of categorization, are managed for cost and schedule performance using Earned Value Management techniques. Fundamental to the consistent management of projects at GTE is the use of standard tools and templates and the standard processes and procedures covered in this documentation. The GTE project management 'framework' essentially comprises: The Standard Project Management Plan [PMP], The PMPs constituent plans and underlying documents and procedures, and The activity and output expectations dictated by the Output Applicability Grid . This documentation intends to assist in meeting the requirements of the framework by summarising and explaining standard requirements, elaborating on expectations of the Project Manager for these, and centralising resources and references. Categorization # Projects undertaken by GTE are categorised by: Lifeycle phase Type Discipline , and Classification These categorizations are initially determined even before the project is awarded, in the prospective (or potential) project phase. This initial assessment is completed by the Proposal Manager and helps inform the bid/decline decision. Upon award of a project, the initial assessment must be revisited and confirmed or amended. The discipline categorization is unlikely to change, however the classification is subject to an additional factor \u2013 Cost Contingency \u2013 which may impact the project classification. Lifeycycle Phase # Type # Projects undertaken by GTE are categorised by: Project - Lump Sum Project - Rates Based Audit Secondment On-Selling Internal Discipline # A project will generally involve one or more disciplines which will dictate some of the deliverables necessary for management of the project. The principal disciplines for projects undertaken by GTE are as follows: Electrical SMP Project Control Communications Drafting Functional Safety It is important to categorize a project by discipline as it impacts the internal deliverables required, and multi-disciplinary projects typically involve a greater level of complexity that necessitates additional project management rigour. Classification # All projects fall into one of three classifications as defined in the table below. The classification is determined through an assessment of the project value and complexity. Classification Description C1 High value, or medium value and high complexity C2 Medium value and medium to low complexity, or low value and high complexity C3 Low value and medium to low complexity Info C1 is considered a \"higher\" classification than C2 and C3.

EVM is a project management methodology that combines scope, schedule, and resource measurements to do this. Fundamental to EVM is the establishment of a performance measurement baseline [Baseline]. The cost and schedule baselines for achieving the baseline scope, are formalised in the approved Baseline Project Schedule. Once established, this can only change to reflect cost and schedule impacts arising from changes in the scope of work. This inherently involves explicit acknowledgement and agreement by the client. In accordance with the PMP, in the process of project control and, EVM credits budgetary earned value [EV] to physical work progress. This earned value is compared to planned value [PV] data from the Baseline and actual cost [AC] data from the cost tracking system at various control accounts on the project WBS. Planned value describes where the project work is supposed to be at any point in the schedule. Earned value provides the indication on progress in budgetary terms, and actual costs show what level of resources have been expended to get there. Each of planned and earned value, and actual cost are often reduced to numeric values at various levels of control account, for a reporting (\u201cdata\u201d) date however each can be plotted as curves (\u201cS-Curves\u201d) over time to provide a more visual representation of project performance. To determine earned value, progress measurements are required for the components of the overall work, whether this be at activity level or some higher summary level. This percentage of total progress is multiplied by the budget for the component work to determine \u201cearn\u201d. The methods used by GTE for determining progress for activities are covered in Section X. The three values (PV, EV, and AC) can be compared at any data date to produce several useful metrics. The following core metrics are used at GTE to manage projects: Metric Abbr.. Formula Purpose Schedule Variance SV = EV - PV Are we ahead or behind schedule?

EVM is a project management methodology that combines scope, schedule, and resource measurements to do this. Fundamental to EVM is the establishment of a performance measurement baseline [Baseline]. The cost and schedule baselines for achieving the baseline scope, are formalised in the approved Baseline Project Schedule. Once established, this can only change to reflect cost and schedule impacts arising from changes in the scope of work. This inherently involves explicit acknowledgement and agreement by the client. In accordance with the PMP, in the process of project control and, EVM credits budgetary earned value [EV] to physical work progress. This earned value is compared to planned value [PV] data from the Baseline and actual cost [AC] data from the cost tracking system at various control accounts on the project WBS. Planned value describes where the project work is supposed to be at any point in the schedule. Earned value provides the indication on progress in budgetary terms, and actual costs show what level of resources have been expended to get there. Each of planned and earned value, and actual cost are often reduced to numeric values at various levels of control account, for a reporting (\u201cdata\u201d) date however each can be plotted as curves (\u201cS-Curves\u201d) over time to provide a more visual representation of project performance. To determine earned value, progress measurements are required for the components of the overall work, whether this be at activity level or some higher summary level. This percentage of total progress is multiplied by the budget for the component work to determine \u201cearn\u201d. The methods used by GTE for determining progress for activities are covered in Section X. The three values (PV, EV, and AC) can be compared at any data date to produce several useful metrics. The following core metrics are used at GTE to manage projects: Metric Abbr.. Formula Purpose Schedule Variance SV = EV - PV Are we ahead or behind schedule?

Preparing plans for the general management of the project and the various underlying processes. Preparing the baseline for the ongoing monitoring and performance management of the project. Conducting project level (non-technical) kick-offs internally and with the client. Broadly, this upfront work involves the refinement of objectives, and definition of the detailed course of action required to meet the objectives. Key stakeholders, including the technical team, should be consulted to complete the detailed planning to an executable resolution. Whilst the intent, and often the requirement, is to quicky commence technical execution of projects, the initial work in planning is critical to the success of the project and should be significantly completed in advance of the commencing technical delivery of the project, ie before commencement of the Execution. Discipline is essential to ensure pressures to commence on the technical aspects of a project are resisted until sufficient planning has been conducted, at least to appropriately establish a baseline for project measurement. Notwithstanding the above, a lot of the work involved in initiating and planning for the project will have been completed at some level of detail in the process of preparing the proposal to the original client RFT/P, or in a preceding lifecycle phase of the project where GTE had been involved. Definition # From a practical perspective, the definition work will generally be largely complete to a near sufficient level and need only be aggregated and finessed or prepared for the consumption of the project team, for example as a redacted copy of the tender document. Project Management Plan # The Project Management Plan covers all aspects of the project including scope, cost and schedule management as well as quality, risk, resourcing and communications. For some projects, it may be necessary to develop a PMP to meet project or client specific needs however, in most instances the GTE Standard Project Management Plan will be appropriate to govern the general management of the project and underlying processes. Baseline Establishment # The majority of work is then generally in preparing the project baseline. The project schedule, granularly 'time-phased' and budget and resource 'loaded', is developed in this process to become the single source of truth for the project baseline. Time-Phased 'Time phased' refers to the distribution over time of the work and budget. By defining and scheduling work at a sufficiently granular level and distributing the budget to similar activity level resolution ('budgeting loading'), the project planned, earned and actual value can be assessed much more accurately over time rather than simply as point, or coarsely linearised, data. This is fundamental to GTE EVM. Resource Loading 'Resource loading' budgeted activities \u2013 referring to assigning resources to these activities \u2013 allows detailed resource management to ensure loading is smoothed to achievable levels and appropriate resources are assigned both to the project and across the company. Generally, the tender schedule \u2013 if this was prepared as a tender requirement \u2013 will lack the resolution and detail for execution and some upfront development is required for it to be \"execution ready\", including increasing activity resolution and sequencing, and re-distributing or refining budgets against activities where the contract arrangement allows this. From a practical perspective, the planning process also occurs continually throughout the project due to inevitable change and evolving understanding of requirements, for example, however the delivery element is considered complete for GTE projects once the initial planning exercise has concluded. This obviously does not prevent the PMP and other outputs of this initial work from being revised as necessary throughout the project. Commencement Checks # The following must be completed before commencing Initiation & Planning for a project: 1. Contract (or purchase order) received 2. Project manager assigned 3. All inputs confirmed available: - GTE tender documentation (where not superseded by the contract) - Contract (or purchase order) documentation, including Scope of Work and applicable standards, etc Activities & Outputs # The Initiation & Planning delivery element will deliver the following activities and outputs, to the extent as determined by the Output Applicability Grid : [Project initiation/proposal handover meeting] Business system setup Project Charter Kick-off meeting (internal - project/resourcing) Kick-off meeting (client - project) Project Management Plan Project Schedule (Baseline) Project Risk Register (preliminary) Project Initiation/Proposal Handover Meeting # In some instances, it may be necessary to provide a PM-level initiation meeting, such as where the nominated Project Manager is unfamiliar with the project from the proposal phase. This initiation/proposal handover meeting is optional, on an as-required basis. Where the meeting is held, it should be minuted using the appropriate template. The meeting should be arranged and run by the Proposal Manager, or person most familiar with the project; and may involve only this person and the assigned Project Manager. Business System Setup # Coming... see the Smartsheet Project Process Management for now. Project Charter # The project charter is a key document that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the PM with the authority to use GTE resources to execute project activities. A subset of the information in the Charter is also the basis for quickly familiarising new personnel to the project. The intent of the Project Charter is to outline, at a very high level: Client's reason(s) for the project (statement of work), High-level scope matrix (in, out, others), Detailed scope governance documents (and locations), GTE's objectives and benefits, including key desired outcomes (project success criteria), Sponsor and main stakeholder(s), Risks, Constraints and assumptions, Budget, and Target dates for delivery (milestones and/or tender schedule) Given the nature of most projects undertaken by GTE being generally a services contract for provision of a component of a client's project, the Project Charter should be a relatively simple, high level document only. In most cases it should essentially aggregate, and occasionally expand, data developed during the preparation of the proposal for the client's project. This document should be generated in Smartsheet (template not yet available...). The Project Charter must be approved by the Project Sponsor. Kick-Off Meeting (Internal \u2013 Project/Resourcing) # Kick-off meetings with the internal resource leads \u2013 as relevant for the teams and disciplines involved with the project \u2013 are mandatory for all GTE projects. Meetings must be minuted using the appropriate template - see Tools & Templates - which also serves as an agenda. The project manager must arrange the meeting. The intent of the project/resourcing kick-off meeting is primarily to advise resource leads that the project has been awarded to GTE and to provide resource requirement timelines to allow appropriate resource planning or inform the project schedule development of resourcing constraints. Accordingly, this meeting should be held as soon as possible following award \u2013 ideally within several days \u2013 once sufficient scheduling information has been prepared. In the interest of providing as much notice as possible to the resourcing leads, it is often sufficient to use the tender schedule for the meeting and use the discussion to drive the development of the detailed project schedule. The meeting will necessarily include a discussion of scope; however, this should remain brief for context only. The project charter is a useful concise resource for this purpose. The meeting should also include project team resources such as cost and document control representatives and will provide the forum for the team to present any queries for the project manager to raise with the client representative at the client kick-off (project) meeting. In some instances, it may be necessary or appropriate to combine this meeting with the client kick-off meeting. Kick-Off Meeting (Client - Project) # Kick-off meetings with the client are mandatory for all GTE projects. Meetings must be minuted. The client project manager will generally arrange the meeting, however, should that not be the case the GTE Project Manager is accountable to GTE for doing so. Note In rare instances, it may be necessary or appropriate to combine this meeting with the internal project/resourcing kick-off meeting. Client kick-off meetings may be conducted by phone in some instances, but this does not negate the need for formal minutes. For higher classification projects, there may be more significant numbers of attendees including GTE and client technical leads, and client stakeholder representatives. The meeting is intended to be broad ranging, covering both commercial, and high-level technical topics. The meeting minutes template should be used as an agenda - see Tools & Templates . Agenda items include: Introductions Scope and Technical Scope summary/overview for the purpose of clarification and confirmation, including to establish the relevant scope documentation such as SOW, Stakeholder Requirements, FUSP Review of major deliverables RFI/TQ process (GTE's preference is Smartsheet) Safety \u2013 project-specific considerations Schedule Major Milestones Timing for the preparation of the proposed Baseline Schedule GTE's preference to use Smartsheet Communication Points of contact for GTE and the client \u2013 whether singular or permitting technical leads to discuss directly and formalise retrospectively where necessary Preferred timing for formal meetings (weekly/monthly/other) Carbon copy list for TQs/RFIs Document Control Transmittal method (GTE's preference is Smartsheet) Client project codes for references (PO number or project numbers) Project specific client document control requirements Commercial Reporting Timesheet approvals Invoicing Other Access requirements (eg for PCN Access, Smartsheet Access, SharePoint, MS Teams Group) Discuss any pressing matters such as imminent site trips for data collection Project Management PLan # Coming...

Cost codes can be assigned, however, at any level of the WBS below L1, and at different levels for any given branch which provides great flexibility for projects of varying complexity.

In addition to the below guidance, the project manager should ensure that it is possible to identify an individual in the project team solely accountable for the performance of each cost account.

GTE manages any change under an integrated approach that assesses the impact to all project limitations which extend beyond just the above dimensions. These limitations include: Scope, Cost, Schedule, Quality, Risks, Resources, and Customer satisfaction. Change Events # As an example, the impact of an increase in the project scope is not a simple exercise of assessing the cost and schedule impact. The additional work may increase resource loadings beyond capacity or result in additional risk to GTE that also needs to be considered. For this reason, any change to the project is assessed for impact using the same integrated approach. The project manager is accountable for ensuring that all changes are identified, assessed, and appropriately communicated. The project team is responsible for the identification of possible change events, and for communicating these to the project manager and assisting with assessing the impact. Any change that has an impact on the client must be communicated by the project manager to the client. The means for communication varies for fixed price and reimbursable projects. There may be instances where a project change will be absorbed by GTE, and in these instances it may be appropriate not to communicate the event to the client. The project manager must ensure that the change event is fully assessed across the above project limitations and it can be confirmed that there is no auxiliary client impact that may not be immediately evident and should be communicated.

These resources may include financial, personnel, and equipment resources but from a GTE Project Manager's perspective resource management is primarily focussed on personnel, or \"human resources\". The end game is essentially to: Ensure that there are people available within GTE with the necessary skill set required for delivery of project work, Decide the number and skill sets of new personnel to hire, and Allocate the available workforce across various projects. Resource management is not just about sufficient capacity, but also adequate utilization of resources. Project Managers will generally be concerned with capacity, and GTE's Resource Managers and management team will be concerned with utilization. GTE intends to conduct most of the planning for resource requirements in the proposal phase for prospective projects to sufficient detail to assess the forecast loading of currently available resources and determine in advance of award whether additional resources will be required. Resource Availability, Capacity, Assignment & Loading # GTE personnel (\"resources\") generally work across several active projects at any one time and so a resource's availability and capacity to complete project work must be assessed from an organizational level ( WBS Level 0). Budgeted work (ie activities with an assigned budget) is assigned to resources at the project activity level. This is known as \"resource assignment\". The total work assigned to a resource at any point in time versus that resource's capacity (generally based on an 8 hour/day) can be considered the \"resource loading\". The standard GTE Smartsheet schedule template calculates this loading, as a percentage, at the budgeted activity level and reports this up for use on organizational level reports and views. Resource loading is also calculated in additional Smartsheets that cover non-project resource assignments, as covered below. Resource Loading at the Project Level # As a starting point, the Project Manager will ensure the planned duration for an activity affords sufficient total capacity (duration x hours/day capacity) for the assigned resource to complete the activity in isolation (ie without yet also considering the resource's other work requirements). In simple terms, the total capacity allocated through the assignment of one or more resources and the duration allowed to complete the work, must exceed the activity's budget. Example For example, a 4 day duration may be established for an activity with a budget of 20hrs. The resource loading (for an 8hr/day resource) would be 20 / (8*4) , or 63%. The above example simplifies the scenario to a single resource but it should be noted that where the duration is not negotiable, it may be necessary to add additional resources to the activity to increase the total capacity. Note In the real world, doubling the personnel on a task rarely results in a halving of the duration required due to inefficiencies of sharing the responsibilities for delivery. The Project Manager should consider this and make adjustments as necessary and/or expect slight inefficiences to budget. Additional to the activity level consideration of loading, the Project Manager must view resource loading at the project level ( WBS Level 1) to ensure the combination of various resource assignments across the project do not result in overloading of resources. This is known as \"resource levelling\" and may result in delaying lower priority activities or assigning alternate resources, for example. The Project Manager must also consider the profile of resource requirements for the project and attempt to avoid significant peaks and troughs in resource requirements, where schedule constraints allow. This is known as \"resource smoothing\" and will be achieved by delaying or stretching activities within the milestone commitments of the schedule. Resource Loading from Non-Project Assignments # In addition to project schedules, Smartsheet schedules also exist to account for resource assignment that may not be covered by a project schedule: Leave Overheads ( may be removed in the future ) Non-Working Time (such as schedule person-specific non-working days) Secondments Audits Small Projects - Comms Potential Projects Resource Loading at the Organization Level # Resource Managers will ensure the resources for which they are responsible, are appropriately loaded. This is done using the Resource Views in Smartsheet and includes identifying both overloaded and underloaded resources. It is the Resource Manager's responsibility to ensure that the Resource View for each relevant resource reflects that resource's actual loading, by: Verifying that all the resource's assignments are visible and accounted for. That may mean a discussion with the relevant Project Manager where it appears a particular project is not showing, or is incorrectly scheduled. Confirming that resources are not overloaded on any particular project schedule. That may mean a discussion with the relevant Project Manager to confirm the requirements are accurate and identify strategies for achieving the work on time in this instance. Capturing resource assignments outside of projects - such as leave and secondments - or ensuring through the appropriate administrative person that these are captured. Process # As resource capacity management is conducted at the organizational level and resource assignment is at the project activity level, the process inherently involves both project resource management, and organizational resource management. The former is the domain of the Project Manager, and the latter is the responsibility of the Resource Managers. Project Resource Management # The Project Manager must: Setup and maintain the project schedule to support resource management, including by: Assign budgets to activities or summary activities in the schedule, such that the overall assigned budget equals the total approved project budget. This is part of project setup process. Identify activities where the hours/day capacity is not the standard 8 hours (\"Non-Standard Capacity\") and allocate additional capacity to these activities . This occurs during project setup and throughout the project as the schedule changes. Establish and maintain delivery periods for activities in the schedule by setting durations and defining start and finish dates, and/or logic that defines start and finish dates. This occurs during project setup, as part of change management, and possibly throughout the project as the schedule changes. Assign a resource, or resources, to budgeted activities in the schedule in consultation with the relevant Resource Managers. Ensure the Resource Management option is enabled on the project schedule. This is enabled out of the box for the GTE standard Smartsheet project schedule but can be verified from the project settings pane . Verify activity level resource loading is achievable.

See the Smartsheet documentation here for more detailed instruction. Features # Activity Level Resource Loading # Project Meeting Minutes # Smartsheet templates are available for routine meetings conducted for GTE projects. The templates may include agenda prompts, and provide a standardised format for recording minutes and actions. These templates are to be used where possible in the interest of uniformity of GTE's product, and to leverage the automation provided by the Smartsheet platform in assigning actions, and notifying and reminding actioners of incomplete actions. Setup # The following outlines the process for using the kick-off meeting minutes and general meeting minutes templates in Smartsheet. The templates are very similar, with the key differences being: - The kick-off meeting minutes template includes agenda prompts. The general meeting minutes has placeholders for the Project Manager to set sections relevant to a particular project. - The general meeting minutes includes a block at the bottom for agreeing the 'Next Meeting' time. Pre-Requisites A Smartsheet license is required. It is assumed the workspace for the project has been created from the project workspace template. If this has not yet been done, first refer to Project Workspace . To setup the minutes: Locate the sheet named 'Pxxxx_KO_MeetingMinutes [TEMPLATE]' or 'Pxxxx_General_MeetingMinutes [TEMPLATE]' , as relevant, in the project workspace. Note: If the sheet cannot be located or was deleted, open the project workspace template and right-click the file of the same name, choose 'Save as New' and save it to the relevant project workspace. Open the sheet and rename it according to the template convention by clicking the existing sheet name in the header bar, where: 'xxxx' is the Project ID, and '[TEMPLATE]' should be removed from the name. Open the Sheet Summary and set the 'Project ID' field to the appropriate value (excluding the leading \"P\"). Note: The Sheet Summary can be opened using the summary icon on the right menu bar. See the Smartsheet documentation here for more detailed instruction. Usage # It is expected that minutes and actions are recorded in Smartsheet during the relevant meeting such that these can be distributed promptly thereafter. It most cases, minimal or no tidy up work should be required. The general meeting minutes sheet is used for each regular general meeting with new minutes and actions added to historical records as the project progresses. The Not Done filter is used to hide old items. Enter the meeting date, time and location in the header rows at the top of the sheet. For the general meeting minutes, additionally adjust the 'Meeting #'. Enter attendees in the relevant cell in the header row. If you start typing a name or email address and aren't seeing the contact list autosuggest the contact, you can click Add New . Tip It is worth taking the time here on first use to establish contacts for attendees not already appearing in Smartsheet so that when they are assigned to actions in the minutes, automated notifications will work correctly with the person's designated email address. Traverse the meeting agenda and record minutes and actions as necessary in the 'Details/Action' column. Actions will be identified as those rows with a 'Status' set. For minutes/notes that do not involve an action, leave the 'Status' empty. Tip The 'Details/Action' column can be indented to make nested minutes and actions. Use the icons on the toolbar, or Ctrl + ] on the keyboard. See the Smartsheet documentation here for further details. Caution All minutes and actions must be indented at least one level below the section header to establish the correct item numbering. Add and re-order rows and sections as necessary to suit the project requirements. Note If more rows are needed in a particular section, insert the rows and drag down the formula in the 'Item' column to maintain the numbering. Rows can be re-ordered by clicking the row handle on the left edge of the screen and dragging to the desired location. If additional sections are required, select the rows covering an existing section (ideally one that is empty) by Shift clicking the handles on the left edge, and copy (or Ctrl + C ) and paste (or Ctrl + V ). Adjust the 'Item' number in the section row as required. Set the 'Status' for actions to \"Open\". Assign a relevant person from the project team and agree a reasonable and achievable 'Due Date'. Tip Smartsheet will flag overdue actions, and the assignee will receive notifications via automated workflows as the 'Due Date' approaches so the date should be chosen with this in mind to avoid unnecessary prompts. For general meetings (does not apply to kick-off meeting) , agree the next meeting date, time and location and enter these in the footer block. Tip The date 7 days after the current meeting date is displayed and will be the default next meeting date. If this is overridden at any stage you can re-establish the formula by typing = and clicking the cell to the right of the text '+7 days'. The following filters are available when using the sheet: - Not Done : hides rows checked as 'Done'. For the general meeting in which the sheet is used for each regular meeting, this filter will generally be applied at all times to avoid showing historical actions and minutes from prior meetings. Automated Workflows # Notification - New Action Assigned # Trigger: 'Assigned To' changes + 'Done' is not checked + 'Status' is not \"Closed\" Action: Email notification to 'Assigned To' with action details. This is an update request, allowing the assignee to provide comments and Example Subject: New Action Assigned for P1900 - Example Project An action has been assigned to you from the kick-off meeting for P1900 - Example Project. Please ensure that you are able to complete the action before the due date (01/01/25) or discuss an extension with the Project Manager. The assignee can provide comments and attachments even without closing the action, for example as progress updates. The 'Closeout Comments' field is not expected to be used unless, upon statusing the action as \"Closed\", there is need for additional clarification. When the action is complete, the assignee should change the 'Status' to \"Closed\". It will not drop off the minutes until the GTE Project Manager checks 'Done', which allows the action closeout to be reviewed and accepted. Notification - Action Due within 3 Days # Trigger: 9am on the day 3 days before due + 'Done' is not checked + 'Status' is not \"Closed\" Action: Email notification to 'Assigned To' with action details. Example Subject: Action Due Soon for P1900 - Example Project An action assigned to you from the meeting for P1900 - Example Project is due soon. Please ensure that you are able to complete the action before the due date (01/01/25) or discuss an extension with the Project Manager. Notification - Action Overdue # Trigger: 9am on the day 1 day after due + 'Done' is not checked + 'Status' is not \"Closed\" Actions: Email notification to 'Assigned To' with action details. Example Subject: Action Overdue for P1900 - Example Project An action assigned to you from the kick-off meeting for P1900 - Example Project is now overdue (Due: 01/01/25). Please action as soon as possible or discuss an extension with the Project Manager. Email notification to 'GTE PM ' with action details. Example Subject: Action Overdue for P1900 - Example Project Action KOM.1.01 assigned to James Ricard is overdue (Due: 01/01/25). An overdue notification has been sent. Status: Open Action: Confirm MCC001 load. Other # Additionally, Smartsheet records: The date when any row is statused as \"Closed\". The date when any row is checked 'Done'. Distribution # The automated workflows ensure timely notifications of actions to those assigned to these, however this does not negate the need to distribute the meeting record as a whole, inclusive of minutes. This should be distributed by email in traditional PDF form, as soon after the meeting as possible and can be done through the Smartsheet interface as follows: With the relevant meeting minutes sheet open, click File > Send as Attachment to open the below window. Enter the appropriate recipients in the 'To' box and modify the 'Subject' and 'Message' as required. The below recommendations can be used. Subject MoM - Pxxxx Project Name - Kick-Off Meeting / Weekly Meeting Message Hi, Please find attached a copy of the minutes from today's meeting and advise any omissions or amendments. Notifications have been sent directly to assignees for all actions. Check the 'CC me' option to ensure a copy is provided as confirmation of the distribution, and for email records. Click options to open the below window and confirm the options for the PDF attachment. Info The default options should be valid as these have been selected in the template. It is important to 'Include comments' so that any conversations against actions are included in the printout. Click Send . Info Smartsheet maintains a record of all distributions sent through the interface which can be a useful reference in the future. Tip - Automate the Distribution for Recurring Meetings If the meeting is held on a regularly recurring basis, the distribution delivery can be automated to be sent out, for example, half an hour following the regular scheduled meeting completion time. Click Schedule on the 'Send as Attachment' popup and set the appropriate 'Delivery Options' to do this. Note that it will be necessary to remember to include any new attendees at subsequent meetings that should receive the automated distribution. Resource Views # Resource Views provide the visibility for the loading of GTE human resources and can be used as part of effective Resource Management . The views are automatically generated from resource assignments made at the project activity level, and from additional non-project schedules designed to capture auxiliary assignments such as leave and secondments. Project Resource Views # A Resource View showing all of the resources currently assigned to activities on a project is available to the Project Manager from the Gantt View of the Smartsheet project schedule. To access: Switch to Gantt View Select the Resource View icon Note: See the Smartsheet documentation here for further details. Team Resource Views # It is not possible to share Resource Views in Smartsheet so these need to be setup for the individual. Pre-Requisites A Smartsheet license is required.
