The categorization also considers the category of project and the disciplines involved.</p> <p>Output Applicability Grid</p> <p>Certain activities must occur, and certain outputs must be generated, throughout the execution of a project undertaken by GTE.

It is created during proposal provisioning as a copy of the PPM Template. PPM Item Individual row in the PPM Instance, corresponding to task to be completed by assigned individual.

Rule Rules are conditions that, when \u201capplied\u201d to the PPM Item, must be fulfilled for the PPM Item to become active in the particular section. Rule applicability is defined in the PPM Master sheet, whereas the actual rule value (true or false) is evaluated in the corresponding PPM Register row. Rules definition is contained in the PPM Documentation sheet. Base Date Specific dates used in the PPM Instance to calculate target date for each individual PPM Item.

EVM is a project management methodology that combines scope, schedule, and resource measurements to do this.</p> <p>For a simple crash course on EVM, see this here.</p> <p>Fundamental to EVM is the establishment of a performance measurement baseline [Baseline]. The cost and schedule baselines for achieving the baseline scope, are formalised in the approved Baseline Project Schedule. Once established, this can only change to reflect cost and schedule impacts arising from changes in the scope of work. This inherently involves explicit acknowledgement and agreement by the client.</p> <p>In accordance with the PMP, in the process of project control and, EVM credits budgetary earned value [EV] to physical work progress. This earned value is compared to planned value [PV] data from the Baseline and actual cost [AC] data from the cost tracking system at various control accounts on the project WBS.</p> <p>Planned value describes where the project work is supposed to be at any point in the schedule. Earned value provides the indication on progress in budgetary terms, and actual costs show what level of resources have been expended to get there.</p> <p>Each of planned and earned value, and actual cost are often reduced to numeric values at various levels of control account, for a reporting (\u201cdata\u201d) date however each can be plotted as curves (\u201cS-Curves\u201d) over time to provide a more visual representation of project performance.</p> <p>To determine earned value, progress measurements are required for the components of the overall work, whether this be at activity level or some higher summary level.

Each Update Request has such a \u201ckey\u201d field, which must change its value so that the RTI is moved to the next workflow step. In most cases this \u201ckey\u201d field is a dropdown menu, which is initially set to <code>---Select Action---</code> and which must be changed to one of the provided values before the Update Request response is submitted. There is only one case \u2013 GTE PM requesting client for RTI response amendments \u2013 when the \u201ckey\u201d field is a text field (<code>Amendments Required</code>) and it\u2019s contents must be edited before the <code>Submit Update</code> button on an Update Request web formed is clicked.</p> <p>If however the \u201ckey\u201d field is not changed and the Update Request response is submitted, the RTI becomes \u201cstalled\u201d i.e. it will not progress further to the next step in the automation workflow. To overcome this issue, there is a built-in mechanism which will detect stalled RTI\u2019s and will attempt moving them to the next workflow step. This mechanism works as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Whenever an Update/Approval Request is sent to a user, the current date is saved in the RTI Register.</li> <li>There is a counter (called \"Limbo Counter\") which is increased every day, monitoring the number of elapsed days since the Update/Approval Request has been sent.</li> <li>If the Limbo Counter reaches a certain predefined value (see Maximum Days in Potential Limbo parameter description), it is assumed that the RTI is either stalled, or has not yet been actioned by the user. At this stage, one of the following will happen:<ol> <li>Update/Approval Request is re-sent to the user (via a Reminder email).</li> <li>Email notification is sent to a GTE PM, requesting a follow-up action. The GTE PM can find out the reason for delay and can re-send the request manually (see Re-trigger RTI At Current State).</li> </ol> </li> <li>After re-sending the RTI Update/Approval Request, the Limbo Counter is reset and the stalled RTI detection process starts again.</li> </ol> <p>When the above mentioned Limbo Counter reaches the limit, it can be either caused by wrong actioning and the RTI being stalled, or by the user\u2019s delay in the RTI response. For this reason, such an RTI is called to be \u201cin limbo\u201d. There are three possible types of \u201climbo\u201d state, each of which is processed differently:</p> <ol> <li>Same person limbo state - Update Request, which was sent to the same used immediately after the Approval Request has been actioned. It is expected that this will be actioned immediately (within the same day) and if not, most likely the RTI is stalled. A specific time limit can be set for this type of limbo, with the default value being 1 day (see Maximum Days in Potential Limbo parameter description).</li> <li>Other person limbo state - Update Request, which was sent to another user. If it has not been actioned after a pre-set period of time, it can either be stalled or user has not yet actioned the Update Request. A specific time limit can be set for this type of limbo, with the default value being 5 days (see Maximum Days in Potential Limbo parameter description).</li> <li>Approval limbo state \u2013 Approval Request, which has not been actioned within a pre-set time. Since Approval Requests do not get to the stalled state, the reason for this type of limbo state is solely the user\u2019s delay in actioning. A specific time limit can be set for this type of limbo, with the default value being 5 days (see Maximum Days in Potential Limbo parameter description).</li> </ol> <p>The \u201climbo\u201d state processing is configurable and the following logic is used:</p> <ol> <li>For each of the above three \u201climbo\u201d types there is a per-project configuration checkbox (<code>Retrigger Potential Limbo</code>) that can be ticked or unticked (see Retrigger Potential Limbo parameter description):<ol> <li>If ticked, the RTI will be retriggered once the limbo state is reached. The exception to this is when the client is actioning the RTI and the <code>Required Response Date</code> has not been yet reached (in this case, the RTI is handled as if the checkbox was unticked \u2013 see the following item).</li> <li>If unticked, the RTI will not be retriggered, but a notification email will be sent to whoever is set up as receiver of Limbo Notification Emails (see Issue Limbo Notification Emails To parameter description).</li> </ol> </li> <li>After the RTI limbo state is actioned (re-triggered, or notification email sent) the limbo state counter is reset and the process of stalled RTI\u2019s monitoring starts again.</li> </ol> <p>The above-mentioned logic has been built to make sure that none of the RTI\u2019s will be not actioned/lost in an unknown state.</p> <p>In addition to the above, there are a few fields in the RTI Register that can be used to monitor the current status and move it to any arbitrary point in the overall workflow:</p> <p>Workflow Log \u2013 indicates the current state the RTI is in (refers to state numbers in the RTI Workflow Diagram).</p> <p>Person Actioning \u2013 indicates a contact name that is currently actioning the RTI and in case it is needed it can be contacted and asked to make the action.</p> <p>Manual Trigger \u2013 a dropdown menu that enables selection of any specific step to which the RTI will be moved after the selection is saved (by saving a sheet or report). This action has to be done with caution and Project Services assistance is recommended.
