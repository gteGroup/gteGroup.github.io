The CBS for GTE projects is simply the hierarchy formed by the cost units, where costs will be captured. This CBS must reside within the project WBS for GTE projects as cost codes are applied to elements in the WBS in a restrictive manner, as explained below. Generally, costs will be captured at a far less granular level than the work activities in the project schedule, so the CBS is essentially a subset of the WBS. Cost Units (Project Control Accounts) # The principal GTE restriction for cost unit designation is that a cost code cannot be applied on multiple branches of the WBS unless it spans all of those branches up to a common pinnacle. The control accounts are then these pinnacles. Cost codes can be assigned, however, at any level of the WBS below L1, and at different levels for any given branch which provides great flexibility for projects of varying complexity.

In addition to the below guidance, the project manager should ensure that it is possible to identify an individual in the project team solely accountable for the performance of each cost account.
