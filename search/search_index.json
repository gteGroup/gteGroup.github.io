Process # Categorization Projects undertaken by GTE undergo a categorization process. This categorization, and in particular the underlying classification , determines the types of project management and engineering records and the general level of rigour required to manage the project, in accordance with the Output Applicability Grid . The categorization also considers the category of project and the disciplines involved. Output Applicability Grid Certain activities must occur, and certain outputs must be generated, throughout the execution of a project undertaken by GTE. The Output Applicability Grid handles the mechanics of determining, from the project categorization, which activities and outputs \u2013 and detail within these \u2013 are necessary. In many cases a particular output or activity may be mandatory across all projects, however the underlying detail could differ vastly through the Output Applicability Grid stipulations for the components of that output. Phases, Processes and Delivery Elements Projects generally span one (lifecycle phase)[#lifecycle-phase] of a client project. These lifecycle phases are outlined to clarify their difference from the distinct project phases within the performance of a project undertaken by GTE. GTE projects are generally structured from a work breakdown perspective in accordance with typical phases of execution that include design, development, and testing. However, the recognition that there are overlapping and enveloping bodies of project management work \u2013 or \"process groups\" \u2013 that occur alongside this direct delivery effort leads to what GTE terms delivery elements . Within the delivery elements that can be considered \"indirect\" to the technical delivery \u2013 or execution \u2013 of the work, project management processes such as cost and schedule management must occur. GTE aligns with PMBOK standards on these processes , and the overall GTE project management process is based around these. Fundamentals All projects, regardless of categorization, are managed for cost and schedule performance using Earned Value Management techniques. Fundamental to the consistent management of projects at GTE is the use of standard tools and templates and the standard processes and procedures covered in this documentation. The GTE project management 'framework' essentially comprises: The Standard Project Management Plan [PMP], The PMPs constituent plans and underlying documents and procedures, and The activity and output expectations dictated by the Output Applicability Grid . This documentation intends to assist in meeting the requirements of the framework by summarising and explaining standard requirements, elaborating on expectations of the Project Manager for these, and centralising resources and references. Categorization # Projects undertaken by GTE are categorised by: Lifeycle phase Category Discipline , and Classification These categorizations are initially determined even before the project is awarded, in the prospective (or potential) project phase. This initial assessment is completed by the Proposal Manager and helps inform the bid/decline decision. Upon award of a project, the initial assessment must be revisited and confirmed or amended. The discipline categorization is unlikely to change, however the classification is subject to an additional factor \u2013 Cost Contingency \u2013 which may impact the project classification. Lifeycycle Phase # Category # Projects undertaken by GTE are categorised by: Project - Lump Sum Project - Rates Based Audit Secondment On-Selling Internal Discipline # A project will generally involve one or more disciplines which will dictate some of the deliverables necessary for management of the project. The principal disciplines for projects undertaken by GTE are as follows: Electrical SMP Project Control Communications Drafting Functional Safety It is important to categorize a project by discipline as it impacts the internal deliverables required, and multi-disciplinary projects typically involve a greater level of complexity that necessitates additional project management rigour. Classification # All projects fall into one of four classifications as defined in the table below. The classification is determined through an assessment of the project value and complexity. Classification Description Extreme High to extremely high project value and high complexity. High Low project value and high complexity, or extremely high project value and low complexity. Moderate High to Low project value and medium to low complexity, or low project value and high complexity. Low Low project value and medium to low complexity. Specifically, the classification is determined using the matrix below with the value banding and complexity determinations made through reference to the sub-sections further below. Classification Matrix Value Banding Low Medium High Very High Extremely High Complexity Rating 5 High (11) High (16) Extreme (20) Extreme (23) Extreme (25) 4 Moderate (7) High (12) High (17) Extreme (21) Extreme (24) 3 Low (4) Moderate (8) High (13) Extreme (18) Extreme (22) 2 Low (2) Low (5) Moderate (9) High (14) Extreme (19) 1 Low (1) Low (3) Moderate (6) High (10) High (15) Value Banding # A project will fall into one of five value bandings \u2013 Low, Medium, High, Very High or Extremely High \u2013 as in the table below where the value banding is the total awarded project fee or sell price, exclusive of any contingency.

Stop sharing the renamed workspace - remove all shared groups from the \"Workspace Shared List\" Share list, leaving only \"GTE Group\" as the Owner. Replace [SOURCE] in the names of all sheets, reports, and dashboards in the live template workspace with [TEMPLATE] . Tip It is possible to use the GTE Project Portal to complete part of this task.

It should be noted that such deployments are not easily tracked by the workspace versioning process so it is critical that these changes be recorded in the Workspace Template Change Log in accordance with the below versioning and documenting guidance. Versioning & Documenting Changes # All changes to the Project Workspace are documented in the PMF Template Change Log Smartsheet as follows: Each release is assigned a version number in the Vx.y form, x being a Major release and y a Minor release. Note A Major release is defined as substantial change of the Project Workspace structure, typically associated with some overall change in other systems/tools or a major change of used techniques/technologies. A Minor release is a change affecting only one or a few templates and implements an existing feature improvement, a new feature implementation or a fix of an issue in a current template. Each release description is formed by a group of rows, each containing a single change description (sub-grouped into 'Schedule' and 'Other'). Each release has a header row, indicating a version number (e.g. Release V1.3) and a release date (entered into the Date column in the time of release). In case the individual change is also implemented in the live Project Workspace version, the corresponding checkbox in the 'Applied to Live' column is ticked. The following columns of the change log are intended for distributing to users as a change description: 'Release Changes' - short change description. 'Date' - date of the change implementation (not the release date, which will always be later). This date will be equal to the 'TEMPLATE BUILD DATE' sheet summary field value in the corresponding template, unless there is a further change to the same template in the same release batch. 'Template' - name of the affected template. The following columns are intended for PMO internal purposes only: 'Type' - User or Background change.

Preparing plans for the general management of the project and the various underlying processes. Preparing the baseline for the ongoing monitoring and performance management of the project. Conducting project level (non-technical) kick-offs internally and with the client. Broadly, this upfront work involves the refinement of objectives, and definition of the detailed course of action required to meet the objectives. Key stakeholders, including the technical team, should be consulted to complete the detailed planning to an executable resolution. Whilst the intent, and often the requirement, is to quicky commence technical execution of projects, the initial work in planning is critical to the success of the project and should be significantly completed in advance of the commencing technical delivery of the project, ie before commencement of the Execution. Discipline is essential to ensure pressures to commence on the technical aspects of a project are resisted until sufficient planning has been conducted, at least to appropriately establish a baseline for project measurement. Notwithstanding the above, a lot of the work involved in initiating and planning for the project will have been completed at some level of detail in the process of preparing the proposal to the original client RFT/P, or in a preceding lifecycle phase of the project where GTE had been involved. Definition # From a practical perspective, the definition work will generally be largely complete to a near sufficient level and need only be aggregated and finessed or prepared for the consumption of the project team, for example as a redacted copy of the tender document. Project Management Plan # The Project Management Plan covers all aspects of the project including scope, cost and schedule management as well as quality, risk, resourcing and communications. For some projects, it may be necessary to develop a PMP to meet project or client specific needs however, in most instances the GTE Standard Project Management Plan will be appropriate to govern the general management of the project and underlying processes. Baseline Establishment # The majority of work is then generally in preparing the project baseline. The project schedule, granularly 'time-phased' and budget and resource 'loaded', is developed in this process to become the single source of truth for the project baseline. Time-Phased 'Time phased' refers to the distribution over time of the work and budget. By defining and scheduling work at a sufficiently granular level and distributing the budget to similar activity level resolution ('budgeting loading'), the project planned, earned and actual value can be assessed much more accurately over time rather than simply as point, or coarsely linearised, data. This is fundamental to GTE EVM. Resource Loading 'Resource loading' budgeted activities \u2013 referring to assigning resources to these activities \u2013 allows detailed resource management to ensure loading is smoothed to achievable levels and appropriate resources are assigned both to the project and across the company. Generally, the tender schedule \u2013 if this was prepared as a tender requirement \u2013 will lack the resolution and detail for execution and some upfront development is required for it to be \"execution ready\", including increasing activity resolution and sequencing, and re-distributing or refining budgets against activities where the contract arrangement allows this. From a practical perspective, the planning process also occurs continually throughout the project due to inevitable change and evolving understanding of requirements, for example, however the delivery element is considered complete for GTE projects once the initial planning exercise has concluded. This obviously does not prevent the PMP and other outputs of this initial work from being revised as necessary throughout the project. Commencement Checks # The following must be completed before commencing Initiation & Planning for a project: 1. Contract (or purchase order) received 2. Project manager assigned 3. All inputs confirmed available: - GTE tender documentation (where not superseded by the contract) - Contract (or purchase order) documentation, including Scope of Work and applicable standards, etc Activities & Outputs # The Initiation & Planning delivery element will deliver the following activities and outputs, to the extent as determined by the Output Applicability Grid : [Project initiation/proposal handover meeting] Business system setup Project Charter Kick-off meeting (internal - project/resourcing) Kick-off meeting (client - project) Project Management Plan Project Schedule (Baseline) Project Risk Register (preliminary) Project Initiation/Proposal Handover Meeting # In some instances, it may be necessary to provide a PM-level initiation meeting, such as where the nominated Project Manager is unfamiliar with the project from the proposal phase. This initiation/proposal handover meeting is optional, on an as-required basis. Where the meeting is held, it should be minuted using the appropriate template. The meeting should be arranged and run by the Proposal Manager, or person most familiar with the project; and may involve only this person and the assigned Project Manager. Business System Setup # Coming... see the Smartsheet Project Process Management for now. Project Charter # The project charter is a key document that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the PM with the authority to use GTE resources to execute project activities. A subset of the information in the Charter is also the basis for quickly familiarising new personnel to the project. The intent of the Project Charter is to outline, at a very high level: Client's reason(s) for the project (statement of work), High-level scope matrix (in, out, others), Detailed scope governance documents (and locations), GTE's objectives and benefits, including key desired outcomes (project success criteria), Sponsor and main stakeholder(s), Risks, Constraints and assumptions, Budget, and Target dates for delivery (milestones and/or tender schedule) Given the nature of most projects undertaken by GTE being generally a services contract for provision of a component of a client's project, the Project Charter should be a relatively simple, high level document only.

Accordingly, this meeting should be held as soon as possible following award \u2013 ideally within several days \u2013 once sufficient scheduling information has been prepared. In the interest of providing as much notice as possible to the resourcing leads, it is often sufficient to use the tender schedule for the meeting and use the discussion to drive the development of the detailed project schedule. The meeting will necessarily include a discussion of scope; however, this should remain brief for context only. The project charter is a useful concise resource for this purpose. The meeting should also include project team resources such as cost and document control representatives and will provide the forum for the team to present any queries for the project manager to raise with the client representative at the client kick-off (project) meeting.

Conducting project level (non-technical) kick-offs internally and with the client. Broadly, this upfront work involves the refinement of objectives, and definition of the detailed course of action required to meet the objectives. Key stakeholders, including the technical team, should be consulted to complete the detailed planning to an executable resolution. Whilst the intent, and often the requirement, is to quicky commence technical execution of projects, the initial work in planning is critical to the success of the project and should be significantly completed in advance of the commencing technical delivery of the project, ie before commencement of the Execution. Discipline is essential to ensure pressures to commence on the technical aspects of a project are resisted until sufficient planning has been conducted, at least to appropriately establish a baseline for project measurement.

The project schedule, granularly 'time-phased' and budget and resource 'loaded', is developed in this process to become the single source of truth for the project baseline. Time-Phased 'Time phased' refers to the distribution over time of the work and budget. By defining and scheduling work at a sufficiently granular level and distributing the budget to similar activity level resolution ('budgeting loading'), the project planned, earned and actual value can be assessed much more accurately over time rather than simply as point, or coarsely linearised, data. This is fundamental to GTE EVM. Resource Loading 'Resource loading' budgeted activities \u2013 referring to assigning resources to these activities \u2013 allows detailed resource management to ensure loading is smoothed to achievable levels and appropriate resources are assigned both to the project and across the company. Generally, the tender schedule \u2013 if this was prepared as a tender requirement \u2013 will lack the resolution and detail for execution and some upfront development is required for it to be \"execution ready\", including increasing activity resolution and sequencing, and re-distributing or refining budgets against activities where the contract arrangement allows this. From a practical perspective, the planning process also occurs continually throughout the project due to inevitable change and evolving understanding of requirements, for example, however the delivery element is considered complete for GTE projects once the initial planning exercise has concluded.

GTE prepares estimates for the labour, third party, material and other costs associated with the work as it is understood from the (potential) client's definition of the work scope, and as built up from an executable activity level. The estimate is presented to the client - along with any methodology, exclusions and qualifications - as part of a 'Proposal' for the works. Generally as dictated by the client, the estimate will be provided as either: A lump sum price, built up from the underlying activity level estimates, or A rates based price, comprising a detailed listing of the individual activities involved and the labour and other rates associated with each activity, or A combination of the two. In all instances, the estimate work used to build up the overall project cost to the client (or sell price) is used as a basis for the budgeted activities to which the project will be managed if/when awarded to GTE by the client. Preparing Estimates in Smartsheet # Creating the Estimate Sheet # The Smartsheet Project Estimate involves underlying resource rates that are subject to change over time. It is critical that all estimates be prepared from the template, which will be updated as and when required. If work from a previous estimate can be used as a basis then this should be copied in after first creating the estimate sheet from fresh - refer to Copying in a Previous Estimate as a Basis . Pre-Requisites A Smartsheet license is required. To create the estimate sheet for the potential project: Copy the folder named '_Pxxxx_GTE_EstimateTemplate' in the '1000 - Potential Projects' workspace in Smartsheet by choosing 'Save as New'. Note: To copy a folder, right click it in the workspace tree and choose 'Save as New'. See the Smartsheet documentation here for more detailed instruction. Name the folder according to the template convention, where: The leading '_' should b removed, 'xxxx' is the Project ID (maintain the leading 'P' in this instance), 'GTE' should be replaced with the Client's name in pascal case, and 'EstimateTemplate' should be replaced with the project name as it reads in the Project Register (which should be pascal cased). Note: Pascal case should be interpreted as all words capitalised, without spaces, and with underscores used to separate words where the first word ends in a capital (eg SCADA_Upgrade). Leave the 'Save in' location as 'Workspaces/1000 - Potential Projects' . When presented with options: Under 'Sharing Options', check 'Sharing'. The templates within the workspace will adopt the appropriate standard collaborators and you can add others later as required. Under 'Automated Workflow & Alert Options', check 'Include recipients & permissions settings'. Leave the 'Data & Formatting Options' all checked. Some templates are pre-populated with reference data and this ensures those rows will be copied to the new workspace, and forms, shared filters, etc will also be available. Leave 'Newly created sheets' selected. Copying in a Previous Estimate as a Basis # If a similar estimate has been prepared in the past then it may be appropriate to use that estimate as a basis. The previous estimate should not be simply copied and then worked on - a new estimate should be created from the template and then this procedure should be followed to copy over relevant rows. Pre-Requisites A new estimate sheet has been created by following Creating the Estimate Sheet . A Smartsheet license is required. To copy rows from the previous estimate sheet to the estimate sheet for the potential project: Open the previous estimate sheet in Smartsheet. Select the relevant rows to be copied. Tip Click a row and then hold the Shift button whilst clicking another row to select all rows between, or hold the Control button while clicking multiple rows where they are not all adjacent.* Right click one of the selected rows on the gripper at the far left of screen and choose 'Copy to Another Sheet...'. Note: If you select parent rows, all child rows underneath will also be copied. After you copy the rows, you can delete the child rows from your destination sheet if these are not required. Caution Do not select 'Move to Another Sheet...'. This will effectively cut and paste the rows, and there is now Undo operation available. In the popup that presents, locate and select the new estimate sheet. Before clicking 'Ok', check the 'Include Attachments' or 'Include Comments' options if desired. Caution Predecessors and formulas won't be preserved, but you can copy and paste them between the two sheets. For more information about how to do this, see the Smartsheet - Using Copy and Paste article . See the Smartsheet documentation here for more detailed instruction. Preparing Tender Schedules in Smartsheet # The Smartsheet Project Estimate forms the basis for the tender schedule. See the Tender Schedule Preparation section. Outputting the Estimate Sheet # Producing a Pricing Schedule to Client Requirements # Migrating the Estimate to the Schedule Upon Award # ??? warning The below is temporary loose guidance only. To be reviewed and eventually automated. Current manual process: In the future schedule, collapse the schedule up to its level 2 core WBS , copy those activity names (as below) and then remove all rows except row 1. Only need to copy if needing to reinstate at the end\u2026 which isn`t necessary if the estimate is already to the schedule format. Level 2 WBS Milestones Initiation & Planning Concept & Confirmation (0-30%) Development (30-100%) Off-Site Testing Site Works (incl Installation, Commissioning) Execution Closeout Monitoring & Control Project Closeout In the estimate, create a column called 'Estimate Row' and give it an incrementing integer from 1 (ie assign 1 to row 1 and then use row above plus 1 formula). FUTURE STATE / TODO... Add this via the API process. Don`t want to add this column into the Estimate template as it requires a non-column-formula which is prone to breaking. Check for any Estimate Budget Issues . These should have been resolved before the estimate was issued anyway. Select all rows except row 1 in the estimate and use the 'Copy to Another Sheet' feature on the right click menu to copy to the schedule. Danger Do not use 'Move to Another Sheet'. This can't be undone and will result in lost information (see predecessors below). Note Rows can be collapsed in the estimate at this point \u2013 no issues. Include Attachments and Comments. In the schedule, select all the new rows (everything except row 1) and indent it beneath row 1. Expand everything. Expand all rows of the estimate and copy predecessors from row 1 to the bottom and paste into the schedule. These aren`t brought in as part of the process. Copy Activity Labour (hrs) to Budget Assigned [hrs] . Check the top line Budget [hrs] equals the top line in the estimate, and then rename Activity Labour (hrs) to Original Budget Assigned [hrs] for reference (or just delete it because it`s in the estimate anyway). Delete the following columns: Revision Client Pricing Schedule Issues Estimate Budget Issues Scope Qualification Input Estimator Scheduled Item? Estimate Resource Loading Qty Time (Hrs) Proposal Manager Filter - Tender Schedule Scope Table Row# FUTURE STATE / TODO... The above list has likely changed and needs to be revisited. Hide (or delete if you want) the following columns: Client Pricing Schedule Ref. Scope Ref. Scope Description Scope Qualifications Resource Role Location FUTURE STATE / TODO... The above list has likely changed and needs to be revisited. Tick Reimbursable? for any reimbursable lines on a lump sum + rates job. (No need to tick if all reimbursable.) At this stage, delete all $ columns in the schedule. FUTURE STATE / TODO... At some point we might bring in the $ columns. If required (because the estimate was built in a non-standard structure), insert X rows and insert the core level 2 WBS that was copied, and then move the estimate rows around within that structure as desired\u2026 keeping an eye on the top line so as not to make errors with the hierarchy that would affect that.","title":"Cost Estimating"},{"location":"processes/cost-management/cost-estimating/#cost-estimating","text":"Budgets for GTE projects are generally developed in the 'Potential (or Prospective) Project' phase following a request for proposal (/tender/quotation).

Generally as dictated by the client, the estimate will be provided as either: A lump sum price, built up from the underlying activity level estimates, or A rates based price, comprising a detailed listing of the individual activities involved and the labour and other rates associated with each activity, or A combination of the two. In all instances, the estimate work used to build up the overall project cost to the client (or sell price) is used as a basis for the budgeted activities to which the project will be managed if/when awarded to GTE by the client.","title":"Cost Estimating"},{"location":"processes/cost-management/cost-estimating/#preparing-estimates-in-smartsheet","text":"","title":"Preparing Estimates in Smartsheet"},{"location":"processes/cost-management/cost-estimating/#creating-the-estimate-sheet","text":"The Smartsheet Project Estimate involves underlying resource rates that are subject to change over time.

Name the folder according to the template convention, where: The leading '_' should b removed, 'xxxx' is the Project ID (maintain the leading 'P' in this instance), 'GTE' should be replaced with the Client's name in pascal case, and 'EstimateTemplate' should be replaced with the project name as it reads in the Project Register (which should be pascal cased). Note: Pascal case should be interpreted as all words capitalised, without spaces, and with underscores used to separate words where the first word ends in a capital (eg SCADA_Upgrade). Leave the 'Save in' location as 'Workspaces/1000 - Potential Projects' . When presented with options: Under 'Sharing Options', check 'Sharing'.

When it comes to delivering a project, we follow our integrity charter value by delivering what we say we will deliver. The scope of a project should be well thought out, and thoroughly estimated to cover all possibilities before the work commences so that change is controlled from the onset, and the need to burden the client with surprises and variation requests is avoided so far as is possible. Nonetheless, changes can occur. The key control in mitigating reputational damage, cost overruns, and/or failure to deliver is in openly, and transparently communicating change to the relevant stakeholders. Project change will generally manifest as an impact to scope, schedule, cost, or a combination of two or more of these elements. GTE manages any change under an integrated approach that assesses the impact to all project parameters which extend beyond just the above dimensions. These parameters include: Scope, Cost, Schedule, Quality, Risks, Resources, and Customer satisfaction. There will be instances in which a high-level assessment of the change across these parameters suggests a need to review the project feasibility from an overall risk perspective to GTE. Considering risk across the areas used in initially assessing potential projects may be useful and could potentially lead to extreme cases GTE proposes that the client abandon the project or award the work to others, such as where the technical requirements evolve significantly to be beyond GTE's capabilities. Change Events # As an example, the impact of an increase in the project scope is not a simple exercise of assessing the cost and schedule impact. The additional work may increase resource loadings beyond capacity or result in additional risk to GTE that also needs to be considered. For this reason, any change to the project is assessed for impact using the same integrated approach. The PM is accountable for ensuring that all changes are identified, assessed, and appropriately communicated. The project team is responsible for the identification of possible change events, and for communicating these to the PM and assisting with assessing the impact. As an absolute minimum, any event that has the potential to result in additional costs to GTE or the client must be identified and formally communicated. Note Project cost should be considered independent of scope. Under reimbursable engagements, if GTE's forecasts indicate a project FAC that significantly exceeds the project BAC - regardless of whether the scope has changed or not - it will generally be apt to communicate a change event capturing the trending cost over-run at some point. The PM must use discretion and experience to determine at what point any forecast over-run is not recoverable, and communicate via change notice at this time. More broadly, any change that has an impact of any kind on the client must be communicated by the PM to the client, at least so far as for the specific impacts that effect the client. Some impacts, such as costs to be absorbed by GTE, may be excluded from the communication where this is deemed appropriate. There may be instances where all impacts of a project change will be absorbed by GTE, and in these instances it may be appropriate not to communicate the event to the client. The PM must ensure that the change event is fully assessed across the above project limitations and it can be confirmed that there is no auxiliary client impacts that may not be immediately evident and should actually be communicated. Where a change event on a lump sum project has an associated cost impact to GTE that is not to be passed on to the client and is likely to exceed the remaining contingency on the project, the PM must prepare an Internal Change Communication and ensure this is presented to the Directors. Change Communications # The means for communication do not differ between fixed price and reimbursable projects. Regardless of commercial arrangement, formal communication of change is made using the following documents: Change Notice (GTE-1005-CHN-001 does not exist yet ) Internal Change Communication (GTE-1005-ICC-001 does not exist yet ) Important The Change Notice is a request for variation to the Approved Budget for the project. It is not a request for variation to the purchase order or contract value. This distinction is explicit on the Change Notice document. Fixed Price / Lump Sum Work # For a lump sum project, a Change Notice will typically be accompanied by a Variation Request, however there will be several instances in which this is not the case in alignment with GTE's desire to prioritise reputation and client relationships. In these instances, the PM may - in consultation with the Engineering Manager and/or Directors - determine that the Change Notice will be issued with the intention only to make the client aware of the change event. This situation - if managed appropriately - helps to derive goodwill, and may also reserve the future right to issue a Variation Request. Reimbursable/Rates Based Work # For a reimbursable project, typically where the change impact (particularly commercial) is small when considered against the overall project, it is likely that Change Notices will be issued independent of any Variation Requests. Under such commercial arrangements there is an opportunity to offset any negative impacts of a change event through positive performance of works not yet performed. GTE will always strive to deliver a project within the original time, budget, and quality constraints even with some (often inevitable) incremental scope change. The Change Notice procedure allows all change events - even including performance trends which forecast a general cost overrun - to be communicated as identified, without the need to request Variations. Approved Change Notices will increase the Approved Budget , which may at times exceed the purchase order or contract value. Where approved additional budget cannot be - or is likely not to be - fully offset by the positive performance of other project works, a Variation Request will be required. The timing of this is at the PM 's discretion but must occur well in advance of the consumption of available purchase order or contract value. Thus Variation Requests may be prepared periodically throughout the project, or at some time where the total invoiced amount for the project approaches the purchase order or contract value. The Variation Request will simply summarise the previously approved additions to budget and establish the additional purchase order or contract value required (which may not necessarily be the full sum of the approved additions). Where a Change Notice is prepared for communication to the client, it will typically not be necessary to prepare an Internal Change Communication as well. In this instance, the Change Notice generally suffices for both external and internal communication. An exception to this situation may be where some impacts of the change are to be absorbed by GTE and not explicitly communicated to the client as part of the overall Change Notice. Variation Requests # Variation Requests are to be submitted to the client where there is a need to vary the purchase order or contract value, and are distinct from the communication of change events as detailed in the Change Comunication section.

These resources may include financial, personnel, and equipment resources but from a GTE Project Manager's perspective resource management is primarily focussed on personnel, or \"human resources\". The end game is essentially to: Ensure that there are people available within GTE with the necessary skill set required for delivery of project work, Decide the number and skill sets of new personnel to hire, and Allocate the available workforce across various projects. Resource management is not just about sufficient capacity, but also adequate utilization of resources. Project Managers will generally be concerned with capacity, and GTE's Resource Managers and management team will be concerned with utilization. GTE intends to conduct most of the planning for resource requirements in the proposal phase for prospective projects to sufficient detail to assess the forecast loading of currently available resources and determine in advance of award whether additional resources will be required. Resource Identification # Resources are identified across the systems used at GTE by their full name, or alternatively by their initials. The initials MUST be three and are compound as follows: FML Where F = first name initial, M = middle name initial, L = last name initial If someone doesn't have a middle name, the initials become: FLA Where F = first name initial, L = last name initial, A = second letter of last name Resource Availability, Capacity, Assignment & Loading # GTE personnel (\"resources\") generally work across several active projects at any one time and so a resource's availability and capacity to complete project work must be assessed from an organizational level ( WBS Level 0). Budgeted work (ie activities with an assigned budget) is assigned to resources at the project activity level. This is known as \"resource assignment\". The total work assigned to a resource at any point in time versus that resource's capacity (generally based on an 8 hour/day) can be considered the \"resource loading\". The standard GTE Smartsheet schedule template calculates this loading, as a percentage, at the budgeted activity level and reports this up for use on organizational level reports and views. Resource loading is also calculated in additional Smartsheets that cover non-project resource assignments, as covered below. Resource Loading at the Project Level # As a starting point, the Project Manager will ensure the planned duration for an activity affords sufficient total capacity (duration x hours/day capacity) for the assigned resource to complete the activity in isolation (ie without yet also considering the resource's other work requirements). In simple terms, the total capacity allocated through the assignment of one or more resources and the duration allowed to complete the work, must exceed the activity's budget. Example For example, a 4 day duration may be established for an activity with a budget of 20hrs. The resource loading (for an 8hr/day resource) would be 20 / (8*4) , or 63%. The above example simplifies the scenario to a single resource but it should be noted that where the duration is not negotiable, it may be necessary to add additional resources to the activity to increase the total capacity. Note In the real world, doubling the personnel on a task rarely results in a halving of the duration required due to inefficiencies of sharing the responsibilities for delivery. The Project Manager should consider this and make adjustments as necessary and/or expect slight inefficiences to budget. Additional to the activity level consideration of loading, the Project Manager must view resource loading at the project level ( WBS Level 1) to ensure the combination of various resource assignments across the project do not result in overloading of resources. This is known as \"resource levelling\" and may result in delaying lower priority activities or assigning alternate resources, for example. The Project Manager must also consider the profile of resource requirements for the project and attempt to avoid significant peaks and troughs in resource requirements, where schedule constraints allow. This is known as \"resource smoothing\" and will be achieved by delaying or stretching activities within the milestone commitments of the schedule. Resource Loading from Non-Project Assignments # In addition to project schedules, Smartsheet schedules also exist to account for resource assignment that may not be covered by a project schedule. These supplementary should only be used as noted in the tables below, and as a rule it is GTE's intent to have a schedule for every project of works undertaken.

Beyond this Workspace, and the schedules within each project Workspace, there should not be any other Smartsheets in the GTE instance with the Resource Management module enabled. Supplementary Schedule Description/Use Leave Captures all personal, community, annual leave etc. All planned leave must be entered in this schedule as soon as it is approved by the Resource Manager. Non-Working Time Where personnel are part-time, or not available to work for reasons other than leave, this supplementary schedule is used to block the resource out for the relevant non-working periods. Secondments Secondment work is typically a regular, ongoing loading and each engagement will be entered into this supplementary schedule to avoid the need for secondment-specific schedules. Audits Audit work is typically a short term, full-time engagement. Each audit resource requirement will be entered into this supplementary schedule to avoid the need for audit-specific schedules.

The TQ wording is important in this messaging. All TQs must be signed as approved by an appropriate client representative under the contract. Where dispensation or deviation from a specific scope stipulation or applicable standard is required, the TQ will expressly state that approval to deviate is sought.","title":"TQs"},{"location":"processes/scope-management/scope-clarification/#rfis","text":"RFIs should be used to formally register requests for client input data which may include site survey data, existing software or settings files, vendor drawings forming a basis for design, etc. Whilst it is possible that simple email requests may suffice for such data in many instances, using the Smartsheet process again provides tracking and management at minimal additional burden, and is consequently highly recommended for all projects. Upon commencement of the execution delivery elements, the technical team should raise RFIs for all client input data set out in the original proposal. As with TQs, the messaging is important around RFIs to ensure these are seen as a valuable part of GTE's projectmanagement process that will deliver a benefit for the client's project in the form of transparent communication ofnecessary inputs that assists the client in providing these in to a timeline that supports the project schedule.","title":"RFIs"},{"location":"processes/scope-management/scope-clarification/#project-tq-rfi-register","text":"TQs and RFIs are to be raised and managed through a project specific ' TQ and RFI Register' in Smartsheet.

This is achieved by Cc-ing all emails to the PPF email address. By doing so, all replies (internal/external) will be automatically delivered to and stored in the PPF. ALL project-related emails (internal/external, out/ingoing) will contain the project code in the 'Pxxxx:' format in their Subject field, for example: Any email received from an external sender, which has not been Cc'd to PPF (typically communication thread initiated by the customer) must be manually moved/copied to the PPF by email's principal recipient Note To easily distinguish between General and Sensitive PPF, '-S' is appended to the project ID in the name of the Sensitive PPF. For example: P2288_S_BHP-BHP_NPI_HV_SCADA_Upgrade as opposed to P2288_BHP-BHP_NPI_HV_SCADA_Upgrade (the General PPF name) The main purpose of the GTE Outlook add-in is to make sure that all the outgoing project-related emails will contain the project code in their subject as well as the PPF email address in their Cc . The GTE Outlook Add-in is loaded automatically upon Outlook start-up. Its function is to check each email before sending and making sure the Cc and Subject fields are properly set up. After clicking the Send button when sending an email (new/reply/forward), the add-in searches the email Subject field for the project code in the 'Pxxxx:' or 'pxxxx:' format. If the code is not found, it displays the following pop-up message: Select one of the following options: No : email is sent without any change to Subject/Cc Cancel : email sending action is cancelled Yes - General : email will later be stored in Projects General Correspondence folder Yes - Sensitive : email will later be stored in Projects Sensitive Correspondence folder After any of Yes - ... buttons is clicked, the following window is displayed: Enter the project code (4 digits) in the Project ID: field (the only editable field), and the Cc and Subject fields will update automatically.

Move 'Folders' higher in the hierarchy. At the same time, move 'Shortcuts' higher as well (this item is also used for quickly accessing PPF): The navigation pane changes to the following: . By clicking the 'Folders' icon, the PPF can be found in the respective subfolder of the Public Folders > All Public Folders : 2. Alternatively, configure the PPF to be accessible offline: Select your account in the File > Account Settings : Click Change\u2026 . Click More Settings . Go to the 'Advanced' tab. Tick the Download Public Folder Favorites checkbox: Click OK . Outlook will need to be re-started afterwards. By doing this, any PPF that is added to the 'Favourites' public folder will be available offline. To add a PPF to Favorites follow the steps below: Right-click on the PPF. From the pop-up menu, select 'Add to Favorites\u2026'. Click Add button: The PPF then appears under the 'Favorites' folder: 3. Using 'Shortcuts' for quick access: Click on Shortcuts in the bottom-left navigation pane: , the Folder Pane shows the default Shortcut structure: The default shortcuts are normally not required, they can be removed by right-clicking and selecting 'Delete Shortcut' Right-click the Shortcuts item and select 'New Shortcut' In the displayed folder hierarchy, select the corresponding PPF (it is recommended that the version from \u201cFavorites\u201d is selected so that shortcuts refer to the offline version if needed): Click OK .

The following is the process for generating a standard project workspace in Smartsheet, which includes standard templates for various project management processes and establishes uniform reporting and dashboarding. Pre-Requisites A Smartsheet license is required. To generate a workspace for the project: Copy the template workspace named 'xxxx_GTE ProjectWorkspaceTemplate' in Smartsheet by choosing 'Save as New'. Note: To copy a workspace, right click it in the workspace tree and choose 'Save as New'. See the Smartsheet documentation here for more detailed instruction. Name the workspace according to the template convention, where: 'xxxx' is the Project ID, and 'GTE' should be replaced with the Client's name in pascal case, and 'ProjectWorkspaceTemplate' should be replaced with the project name as it reads in the Project Register (which should be pascal cased). Note: Pascal case should be interpreted as all words capitalised, without spaces, and with underscores used to separate words where the first word ends in a capital (eg SCADA_Upgrade). When presented with options: Under 'Sharing Options', check 'Sharing'. The templates within the workspace will adopt the appropriate standard collaborators and you can add others later as required. Under 'Automated Workflow & Alert Options', check 'Include recipients & permissions settings'. Leave the 'Data & Formatting Options' all checked. Some templates are pre-populated with reference data and this ensures those rows will be copied to the new workspace, and forms, shared filters, etc will also be available. Leave 'Newly created sheets' selected. Project Schedule # A consistent project schedule structure is required to facilitate team familiarisation and to present uniform to the client for all GTE projects. The GTE standard project schedule also includes reporting calculations required for organization wide analysis. Setup # The project schedule is to be created and managed in Smartsheet. The following outlines the process for generating a standard project schedule in Smartsheet. Pre-Requisites A Smartsheet license is required. It is assumed the workspace for the project has been created from the project workspace template. If this has not yet been done, first refer to Project Workspace . To setup the project schedule: Locate the sheet named 'Pxxxx_Schedule [TEMPLATE]' in the project workspace. Note: If the sheet cannot be located or was deleted, open the project workspace template and right-click the file of the same name, choose 'Save as New' and save it to the relevant project workspace. Open the sheet and rename it according to the template convention by clicking the existing sheet name in the header bar, where: 'xxxx' is the Project ID, and '[TEMPLATE]' should be removed from the name. Open the Sheet Summary and set the 'Project ID' field to the appropriate value (excluding the leading \"P\"). Note: The Sheet Summary can be opened using the summary icon on the right menu bar. See the Smartsheet documentation here for more detailed instruction. Note If you want to manually migrate the cost estimate to the project schedule please refer to Migrating the Estimate to the Schedule Upon Award for details. Features # Activity Level Resource Loading # Project Meeting Minutes # Smartsheet templates are available for routine meetings conducted for GTE projects. The templates may include agenda prompts, and provide a standardised format for recording minutes and actions. These templates are to be used where possible in the interest of uniformity of GTE's product, and to leverage the automation provided by the Smartsheet platform in assigning actions, and notifying and reminding actioners of incomplete actions. Setup # The following outlines the process for using the kick-off meeting minutes and general meeting minutes templates in Smartsheet. The templates are very similar, with the key differences being: - The kick-off meeting minutes template includes agenda prompts. The general meeting minutes has placeholders for the Project Manager to set sections relevant to a particular project. - The general meeting minutes includes a block at the bottom for agreeing the 'Next Meeting' time. Pre-Requisites A Smartsheet license is required. It is assumed the workspace for the project has been created from the project workspace template. If this has not yet been done, first refer to Project Workspace . To setup the minutes: Locate the sheet named 'Pxxxx_KO_MeetingMinutes [TEMPLATE]' or 'Pxxxx_General_MeetingMinutes [TEMPLATE]' , as relevant, in the project workspace. Note: If the sheet cannot be located or was deleted, open the project workspace template and right-click the file of the same name, choose 'Save as New' and save it to the relevant project workspace. Open the sheet and rename it according to the template convention by clicking the existing sheet name in the header bar, where: 'xxxx' is the Project ID, and '[TEMPLATE]' should be removed from the name. Open the Sheet Summary and set the 'Project ID' field to the appropriate value (excluding the leading \"P\"). Note: The Sheet Summary can be opened using the summary icon on the right menu bar. See the Smartsheet documentation here for more detailed instruction. Usage # It is expected that minutes and actions are recorded in Smartsheet during the relevant meeting such that these can be distributed promptly thereafter. It most cases, minimal or no tidy up work should be required. The general meeting minutes sheet is used for each regular general meeting with new minutes and actions added to historical records as the project progresses. The Not Done filter is used to hide old items. Enter the meeting date, time and location in the header rows at the top of the sheet. For the general meeting minutes, additionally adjust the 'Meeting #'. Enter attendees in the relevant cell in the header row. If you start typing a name or email address and aren't seeing the contact list autosuggest the contact, you can click Add New . Tip It is worth taking the time here on first use to establish contacts for attendees not already appearing in Smartsheet so that when they are assigned to actions in the minutes, automated notifications will work correctly with the person's designated email address. Traverse the meeting agenda and record minutes and actions as necessary in the 'Details/Action' column. Actions will be identified as those rows with a 'Status' set. For minutes/notes that do not involve an action, leave the 'Status' empty. Tip The 'Details/Action' column can be indented to make nested minutes and actions. Use the icons on the toolbar, or Ctrl + ] on the keyboard. See the Smartsheet documentation here for further details. Caution All minutes and actions must be indented at least one level below the section header to establish the correct item numbering. Add and re-order rows and sections as necessary to suit the project requirements. Note If more rows are needed in a particular section, insert the rows and drag down the formula in the 'Item' column to maintain the numbering. Rows can be re-ordered by clicking the row handle on the left edge of the screen and dragging to the desired location. If additional sections are required, select the rows covering an existing section (ideally one that is empty) by Shift clicking the handles on the left edge, and copy (or Ctrl + C ) and paste (or Ctrl + V ). Adjust the 'Item' number in the section row as required. Set the 'Status' for actions to \"Open\". Assign a relevant person from the project team and agree a reasonable and achievable 'Due Date'. Tip Smartsheet will flag overdue actions, and the assignee will receive notifications via automated workflows as the 'Due Date' approaches so the date should be chosen with this in mind to avoid unnecessary prompts. For general meetings (does not apply to kick-off meeting) , agree the next meeting date, time and location and enter these in the footer block. Tip The date 7 days after the current meeting date is displayed and will be the default next meeting date. If this is overridden at any stage you can re-establish the formula by typing = and clicking the cell to the right of the text '+7 days'. The following filters are available when using the sheet: - Not Done : hides rows checked as 'Done'. For the general meeting in which the sheet is used for each regular meeting, this filter will generally be applied at all times to avoid showing historical actions and minutes from prior meetings. Automated Workflows # Notification - New Action Assigned # Trigger: 'Assigned To' changes + 'Done' is not checked + 'Status' is not \"Closed\" Action: Email notification to 'Assigned To' with action details. This is an update request, allowing the assignee to provide comments and Example Subject: New Action Assigned for P1900 - Example Project An action has been assigned to you from the kick-off meeting for P1900 - Example Project. Please ensure that you are able to complete the action before the due date (01/01/25) or discuss an extension with the Project Manager. The assignee can provide comments and attachments even without closing the action, for example as progress updates. The 'Closeout Comments' field is not expected to be used unless, upon statusing the action as \"Closed\", there is need for additional clarification. When the action is complete, the assignee should change the 'Status' to \"Closed\". It will not drop off the minutes until the GTE Project Manager checks 'Done', which allows the action closeout to be reviewed and accepted. Notification - Action Due within 3 Days # Trigger: 9am on the day 3 days before due + 'Done' is not checked + 'Status' is not \"Closed\" Action: Email notification to 'Assigned To' with action details. Example Subject: Action Due Soon for P1900 - Example Project An action assigned to you from the meeting for P1900 - Example Project is due soon. Please ensure that you are able to complete the action before the due date (01/01/25) or discuss an extension with the Project Manager. Notification - Action Overdue # Trigger: 9am on the day 1 day after due + 'Done' is not checked + 'Status' is not \"Closed\" Actions: Email notification to 'Assigned To' with action details. Example Subject: Action Overdue for P1900 - Example Project An action assigned to you from the kick-off meeting for P1900 - Example Project is now overdue (Due: 01/01/25). Please action as soon as possible or discuss an extension with the Project Manager. Email notification to 'GTE PM ' with action details. Example Subject: Action Overdue for P1900 - Example Project Action KOM.1.01 assigned to James Ricard is overdue (Due: 01/01/25). An overdue notification has been sent. Status: Open Action: Confirm MCC001 load. Other # Additionally, Smartsheet records: The date when any row is statused as \"Closed\". The date when any row is checked 'Done'. Distribution # The automated workflows ensure timely notifications of actions to those assigned to these, however this does not negate the need to distribute the meeting record as a whole, inclusive of minutes. This should be distributed by email in traditional PDF form, as soon after the meeting as possible and can be done through the Smartsheet interface as follows: With the relevant meeting minutes sheet open, click File > Send as Attachment to open the below window. Enter the appropriate recipients in the 'To' box and modify the 'Subject' and 'Message' as required. The below recommendations can be used. Subject MoM - Pxxxx Project Name - Kick-Off Meeting / Weekly Meeting Message Hi, Please find attached a copy of the minutes from today's meeting and advise any omissions or amendments. Notifications have been sent directly to assignees for all actions. Check the 'CC me' option to ensure a copy is provided as confirmation of the distribution, and for email records. Click options to open the below window and confirm the options for the PDF attachment. Info The default options should be valid as these have been selected in the template. It is important to 'Include comments' so that any conversations against actions are included in the printout. Click Send . Info Smartsheet maintains a record of all distributions sent through the interface which can be a useful reference in the future. Tip - Automate the Distribution for Recurring Meetings If the meeting is held on a regularly recurring basis, the distribution delivery can be automated to be sent out, for example, half an hour following the regular scheduled meeting completion time. Click Schedule on the 'Send as Attachment' popup and set the appropriate 'Delivery Options' to do this. Note that it will be necessary to remember to include any new attendees at subsequent meetings that should receive the automated distribution. Resource Views # Resource Views provide the visibility for the loading of GTE human resources and can be used as part of effective Resource Management . The views are automatically generated from resource assignments made at the project activity level, and from additional non-project schedules designed to capture auxiliary assignments such as leave and secondments. Project Resource Views # A Resource View showing all of the resources currently assigned to activities on a project is available to the Project Manager from the Gantt View of the Smartsheet project schedule.

It most cases, minimal or no tidy up work should be required. The general meeting minutes sheet is used for each regular general meeting with new minutes and actions added to historical records as the project progresses. The Not Done filter is used to hide old items. Enter the meeting date, time and location in the header rows at the top of the sheet. For the general meeting minutes, additionally adjust the 'Meeting #'. Enter attendees in the relevant cell in the header row. If you start typing a name or email address and aren't seeing the contact list autosuggest the contact, you can click Add New . Tip It is worth taking the time here on first use to establish contacts for attendees not already appearing in Smartsheet so that when they are assigned to actions in the minutes, automated notifications will work correctly with the person's designated email address. Traverse the meeting agenda and record minutes and actions as necessary in the 'Details/Action' column. Actions will be identified as those rows with a 'Status' set. For minutes/notes that do not involve an action, leave the 'Status' empty. Tip The 'Details/Action' column can be indented to make nested minutes and actions. Use the icons on the toolbar, or Ctrl + ] on the keyboard. See the Smartsheet documentation here for further details. Caution All minutes and actions must be indented at least one level below the section header to establish the correct item numbering. Add and re-order rows and sections as necessary to suit the project requirements. Note If more rows are needed in a particular section, insert the rows and drag down the formula in the 'Item' column to maintain the numbering. Rows can be re-ordered by clicking the row handle on the left edge of the screen and dragging to the desired location. If additional sections are required, select the rows covering an existing section (ideally one that is empty) by Shift clicking the handles on the left edge, and copy (or Ctrl + C ) and paste (or Ctrl + V ). Adjust the 'Item' number in the section row as required. Set the 'Status' for actions to \"Open\". Assign a relevant person from the project team and agree a reasonable and achievable 'Due Date'. Tip Smartsheet will flag overdue actions, and the assignee will receive notifications via automated workflows as the 'Due Date' approaches so the date should be chosen with this in mind to avoid unnecessary prompts. For general meetings (does not apply to kick-off meeting) , agree the next meeting date, time and location and enter these in the footer block. Tip The date 7 days after the current meeting date is displayed and will be the default next meeting date. If this is overridden at any stage you can re-establish the formula by typing = and clicking the cell to the right of the text '+7 days'. The following filters are available when using the sheet: - Not Done : hides rows checked as 'Done'. For the general meeting in which the sheet is used for each regular meeting, this filter will generally be applied at all times to avoid showing historical actions and minutes from prior meetings.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"tools-and-templates/smartsheet/#automated-workflows","text":"","title":"Automated Workflows"},{"location":"tools-and-templates/smartsheet/#notification-new-action-assigned","text":"Trigger: 'Assigned To' changes + 'Done' is not checked + 'Status' is not \"Closed\" Action: Email notification to 'Assigned To' with action details.
