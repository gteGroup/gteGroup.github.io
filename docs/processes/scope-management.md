# Scope Management 

## Scope Clarification

### TQs & RFIs

All queries to the client of a technical nature for projects undertaken by GTE, should be raised as either a TQ or an RFI using the Smartsheet form. This form generates an entry into the enterprise wide TQ/RFI Register providing a uniform approach that assists with tracking and management with benefits such as automated approval workflows and email follow ups.

#### TQs

TQs are contractual documents requiring formal contractual replies. The project manager must manage the client relationship such that it is accepted that TQs will be raised for any client response upon which GTE will rely technically. Queries made via other means such as email cannot necessarily be relied upon contractually in the event of a dispute and are not tracked and managed with the attention afforded by GTE’s Smartsheet process.

GTE can appear overly commercial if the client communication is not managed appropriately, and this has the potentialto adversely affect the relationship with the client. The project manager should ensure that TQs are seen as presentedas routine process and a necessary means for clarifying the scope and ensuring the client receives the product it expects, rather than a commercial coverage exercise. The TQ wording is important in this messaging. 

All TQs must be signed as approved by an appropriate client representative under the contract.

Where dispensation or deviation from a specific scope stipulation or applicable standard is required, the TQ will expressly state that approval to deviate is sought.

#### RFIs

RFIs should be used to formally register requests for client input data which may include site survey data, existing software or settings files, vendor drawings forming a basis for design, etc. Whilst it is possible that simple email requests may suffice for such data in many instances, using the Smartsheet process again provides tracking and management at minimal additional burden, and is consequently highly recommended for all projects. Upon commencement of the execution delivery elements, the technical team should raise RFIs for all client input data set out in the original proposal.

As with TQs, the messaging is important around RFIs to ensure these are seen as a valuable part of GTE's projectmanagement process that will deliver a benefit for the client's project in the form of transparent communication ofnecessary inputs that assists the client in providing these in to a timeline that supports the project schedule.

#### Project TQ & RFI Register

TQs and RFIs are to be raised and managed through a project specific 'TQ and RFI Register' in Smartsheet. The Smartsheet automates the required workflows and notifications, and provides standardised reporting.

**Pre-Requisites**

- It is assumed the workspace for the project has been created from the project workspace template. If this has not yet been done, first refer to [Project Workspace Setup](project-setup/#project-workspace-setup).

**Process**

1. Locate the sheet named ‘Pxxxx_TQandRFI_Register [TEMPLATE]’ in the project workspace.

    *Note: If the sheet cannot be located or was deleted, open the project workspace template and right-click the file of the same name, choose ‘Save as New’ and save it to the relevant project workspace.*

2. Open the sheet and rename it according to the template convention by clicking the existing sheet name in the header bar, where:
    - 'xxxx' is the Project ID, and
    - '[TEMPLATE]' should be removed from the name.
    
3. Open the Sheet Summary and set the 'Project ID' field to the appropriate value (excluding the leading "P").

    *Note: The Sheet Summary can be opened using the summary icon   on the right menu bar. See the Smartsheet documentation here for more detailed instruction.*
