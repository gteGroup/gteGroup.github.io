# Kick-Off Meeting Agenda (Client - Project)
Kick-off meetings with the client are mandatory for all GTE projects.

Meetings must be minuted using the appropriate template<in Section 9.4>. 

The client project manager will generally arrange the meeting, however, should that not be the case the GTE project manager is accountable to GTE for doing so.

In rare instances, it may be necessary or appropriate to combine this meeting with the internal project/resourcing kick-off meeting.

Client kick-off meetings may be conducted by phone in some instances, but this does not negate the need for formal minutes. For higher classification projects, there may be more significant numbers of attendees including GTE and client technical leads, and client stakeholder representatives.

The meeting is intended to be broad ranging, covering both technical and commercial discussions. The meeting minutes template should be used as an agenda. Agenda items include:

1. Introductions
2. Scope and Technical
    - Scope summary/overview for the purpose of clarification and confirmation, including to establish the relevant scope documentation such as SOW, Stakeholder Requirements, FUSP
    - Review of major deliverables
    - RFI/TQ process (GTE’s preference is Smartsheet)
3. Safety – project-specific considerations
4. Schedule
    - Major Milestones
    - Timing for the preparation of the proposed Baseline Schedule
    - GTE’s preference to use Smartsheet
5. Communication
    - Points of contact for GTE and the client – whether singular or permitting technical leads to discuss directly and formalise retrospectively where necessary
    - Preferred timing for formal meetings (weekly/monthly/other)
    - Carbon copy list for TQs/RFIs
6. Document Control
    - Transmittal method (GTE’s preference is Smartsheet)
    - Client project codes for references (PO number or project numbers)
    - Project specific client document control requirements
7. Commercial
    - Reporting
    - Timesheet approvals
    - Invoicing
8. Other
    - Access requirements (eg for PCN Access, Smartsheet Access, SharePoint, MS Teams Group)
